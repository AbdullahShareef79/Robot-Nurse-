# A Study on Pepper Robot 2.9 to Perform Nursery Screening

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of Pepper Robot 2.9 to conduct nursery screenings. The goal is to enhance the efficiency and interactivity of nursery-level health assessments using Pepper's conversational and interactive capabilities. The project leverages Pepper's built-in functionalities and custom programming to make the process engaging, accurate, and user-friendly.

## Features
- **Automated Screening Process**: Pepper Robot interacts with children, parents, or caregivers to gather relevant screening information.
- **Voice-Interactive Questionnaires**: Pepper conducts verbal screenings where participants can respond naturally.
- **Customizable Question Sets**: Easily modify the screening questions to align with specific health or developmental requirements.
- **Multilingual Support**: Support for multiple languages to cater to diverse nursery environments.
- **Results Presentation**: Displays and/or provides verbal feedback on screening results.

## Technologies Used
- **Pepper Robot SDK 2.9**: Provides the core functionality to program and control Pepper.
- **Kotlin**: For developing and integrating interactive app features.
- **Android Studio**: For building and testing the project’s Android application.
- **QiChat**: For handling conversational interactions with Pepper.

## How It Works
1. **Introduction**: Pepper greets the user and provides an overview of the screening process.
2. **Questionnaire**: Pepper asks screening questions verbally, and users can respond either via voice or touch inputs.
3. **Analysis**: Based on user responses, the system processes and evaluates the data.
4. **Feedback**: Pepper delivers results and recommendations, either verbally or visually.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
